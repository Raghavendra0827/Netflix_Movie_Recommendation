# Movie Recommendation App

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation App project repository! ðŸŽ¬

## Project Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation App that suggests movies to users based on collaborative filtering. It uses a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) model trained on movie ratings to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## Key Features

- **User Selection**: Users can select their user ID from a dropdown menu to receive personalized movie recommendations.
- **Recommendation Generation**: The app generates movie recommendations based on the user's selected ID using the SVD model.
- **Interactive Interface**: Streamlit is used to create an interactive web interface for users to select their ID and view recommendations.
- **Visualization**: The app displays the top recommended movies along with a heatmap visualization of their estimated scores.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/Raghavendra0827/Netflix_Movie_Recommendation.git`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Run the App**: Execute the Streamlit web application by running `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal.
4. **Select User ID**: Select a user ID from the dropdown menu to receive personalized recommendations.
5. **Get Recommendations**: Click the "Recommend Movies" button to view the top recommended movies for the selected user.
6. **Explore Recommendations**: Explore the recommended movies displayed in the app interface and discover new movies to watch!

# NLP Sentiment Analysis

Welcome to the NLP Sentiment Analysis project repository! ðŸš€

## Project Overview

In this project, we delve into the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with sentiment analysis, leveraging Python and machine learning techniques to extract invaluable insights from textual data. The mission is to empower businesses and stakeholders with actionable intelligence derived from the sentiment analysis of text data.

## Key Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Utilize NLTK for text preprocessing, including tokenization and stop word removal, to prepare textual data for analysis.
- **Bag-of-Words Representation**: Implement a Bag-of-Words approach to convert text data into numerical vectors suitable for machine learning models.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Train a Random Forest classifier to predict sentiment labels based on the Bag-of-Words representations of text data.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Deploy a Streamlit web application to facilitate interactive sentiment analysis predictions for user-provided text inputs.

SentimentX analyser app: https://sentimentanalyzerx-app.streamlit.app
## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/Raghavendra0827/SentimentAnalyzerX.git`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Explore the Code**: Navigate through the codebase to understand the implementation of text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and web application deployment.
4. **Run the Web App**: Execute the Streamlit web application by running `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal. Access the app via the provided URL and input text to obtain sentiment analysis predictions.
