# Movie Recommendation App

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation App project repository! ðŸŽ¬

## Project Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation App that suggests movies to users based on collaborative filtering. It uses a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) model trained on movie ratings to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## Key Features

- **User Selection**: Users can select their user ID from a dropdown menu to receive personalized movie recommendations.
- **Recommendation Generation**: The app generates movie recommendations based on the user's selected ID using the SVD model.
- **Interactive Interface**: Streamlit is used to create an interactive web interface for users to select their ID and view recommendations.
- **Visualization**: The app displays the top recommended movies along with a heatmap visualization of their estimated scores.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/Raghavendra0827/Netflix_Movie_Recommendation.git`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Run the App**: Execute the Streamlit web application by running `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal.
4. **Select User ID**: Select a user ID from the dropdown menu to receive personalized recommendations.
5. **Get Recommendations**: Click the "Recommend Movies" button to view the top recommended movies for the selected user.
